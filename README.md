# Maya Projects

Welcome to the `projetosMaya` repository! This repository contains a collection of projects developed using Autodesk Maya, focusing on 3D modeling, animation, and rendering.

## Main Goal

The main goal of this repository is to document and showcase my studies and progress in 3D modeling, animation, and rendering using Autodesk Maya.  
By sharing my work, I hope to keep myself motivated and I want this repository to be a space where we can swap tips, learn from each other, and get inspired in the 3D world.
